Q	it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi-mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
Q	a capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed
Q	the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm-2 sm-3 or sm-6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg-51 capability ddg 1000's advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability

Q	for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24-hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
Q	during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
Q	both of these businesses are co-operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherford's odour issues and that's a very positive outcome
Q	we were able to analyse four samples from our odour-capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporation's sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
Q	based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
Q	hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible

Q	no arguments no bargains no stories
Q	just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day don't ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
Q	i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front-lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how

Q	run out of town
Q	police are of the opinion that although the options of avo's and the like are being pursued it will not deter those persons residing in willow drive from harassing the couple
Q	police are fearful that the violence may get out of hand and the best way to avoid this is through relocation
Q	vet tenants more thoroughly and not use our area as a dumping ground for troublemakers
Q	but it wasn't like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
Q	we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed
Q	we had been inside for only a few minutes before people began throwing bricks at the building
Q	i ran out with my 18-month-old baby in my arms my other children following
Q	the taxi driver waiting for us was astonished at what was happening
Q	our families are all safe now and i want nothing from anybody
Q	but i feel i must speak up now or i will have it on my conscience forever if i keep quiet and someone is killed in willow drive
Q	living there can be a nightmare and i feel so sorry for people who still live with all those troubles

Q	no one in the street will talk to police because they are so frightened

Q	i've never done anything like this before
Q	my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but i'm really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully they'll be kinder to me than i am on myself and that's part of the therapy
Q	i've been listening to carol on the radio for years but i've never seen her so this has been a great experience
Q	because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
Q	one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed you're being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
Q	also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but it's a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
Q	and for people who have life-long self-esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
Q	this is why i work in radio and not television

Q	it was a bit of a surprise it just arrived
Q	it's a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because we're so diverse and the community don't really have an understanding of what we do
Q	the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
Q	disability services like mai-wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
Q	this is a one-off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
Q	this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
Q	there's nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
