Emily & I finished working on the code for data entry, and we successfully got it to run with a proper makefile.
This is the first log of our DEVELOPMENT file, I suppose Deborah & Zwaadul will have the next say here.
They will be taking care of sorting our data into a tree of sorts - this will use some sort of
BFS, DFS, Djistrka's Algorithm, etc.
Until then, cheerio!

Zawaadul and I added a custom AVLTree class suited to our purposes. We added a function for converting the string
timestamp format into a double and added code to the main function which should add all the elements in the vector
of phrase matches into an AVLTree. Our compiling issues are back (don't know what to do about that), so we don't
know if it will run properly, but we did as much debugging as we could given the circumstances. - Deborah
