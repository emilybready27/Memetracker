Emily & I finished working on the code for data entry, and we successfully got it to run 
with a proper makefile. This is the first log of our DEVELOPMENT file, I suppose Deborah & Zwaadul 
will have the next say here. They will be taking care of sorting our data into a tree of sorts - 
this will use some sort of BFS, DFS, Djistrka's Algorithm, etc.
Until then, cheerio! - Matthew

Zawaadul and I added a custom AVLTree class suited to our purposes. We added a function for converting 
the string timestamp format into a double and added code to the main function which should add all 
the elements in the vector of phrase matches into an AVLTree. Our compiling issues are back 
(don't know what to do about that), so we don't know if it will run properly, 
but we did as much debugging as we could given the circumstances. - Deborah

All of us came together to get the segment finder working after some issues with the Makefile. 
We finally got the segment finder to work at full capacity, and even with a new, larger test file,
the program outputs what we want almost instantaneously.
Now we have to make the graph of multiple sets of results - best of luck to Deborah and Zwaadul!
