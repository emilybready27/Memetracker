Emily & I finished working on the code for data entry, and we successfully got it to run with a proper makefile.
This is the first log of our DEVELOPMENT file, I suppose Deborah & Zwaadul will have the next say here.
They will be taking care of sorting our data into a tree of sorts - this will use some sort of
BFS, DFS, Djistrka's Algorithm, etc.
Until then, cheerio!
